\section*{Abstract}
  
  In this project, an analysis of the state of the art regarding tools for the deployment of IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) is done with the aim of carrying out virtualized heterogeneous network deployments, applicable to CyberRange platforms for training and in the cybersecurity field. This deployment is focused on Terraform technology, with Cloud-based providers and Docker lightweight virtualization technology.

  The main idea is, from high-level scenario descriptions (JSON, YAML, XML files...), parameterize and adapt these files to the Terraform deployment technology, avoiding the dependency associated with the physical environments where virtualized network scenarios will be deployed. The deployment refers both to the network topology, interconnections, and the provisioning of the final machines. Once the development is done, a catalog of scenarios to be virtualized automatically will be handled, which will be used to carry out cyber exercises.

  The code used in this work is available in the following GitHub repository:
